                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>Indonesian manufacturing was growing fast, but workforce training lagged behind. Factory workers
                        were being onboarded with printed manuals and classroom lectures — methods that were slow,
                        inconsistent, and expensive in terms of errors and accidents. Global MNCs operating in the
                        region needed standardized, scalable training across dozens of facilities.</p>

                    <h3>What We Built</h3>
                    <p>We built VR-based training simulations and accompanying physical training kits for industrial use
                        cases: equipment operation, safety protocols, and process standardization.</p>

                        <li><strong>Built and led</strong> an 11-person team from scratch; promoted 3 members into

                        <li><strong>Navigated</strong> government procurement, economic turbulence, and a pandemic while

                    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                    <p>Building a deep-tech product company in Indonesia taught me more than any MBA could simulate. I
                        learned to sell to skeptical procurement committees, build a team in a market where talent is
                        scarce, and keep the lights on through economic turbulence. Most importantly: conviction is the
                        most important asset a founder can have — the ability to hold your vision clearly while
                        iterating relentlessly on execution.</p>
