                    <h3>The Invention</h3>
                    <p>This patent describes an AGV built on a pocket chassis, a modular, compact structural frame that
                        integrates four independently driven swerve motors. The result is a vehicle that can move
                        omnidirectionally, rotate in place, and navigate tight factory corridors that conventional AGVs
                        cannot reach. It targets point-to-point navigation accuracy within 10cm, a payload capacity of
                        up to 100kg, and route changes that can be made in real time without any physical infrastructure
                        modifications.</p>
                    <ul class="detail-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Pocket chassis:</strong> Compact, modular frame that reduces the vehicle's footprint
                            while maximizing payload capacity. Small but not to be underestimated, much like a
                            well-packed carry-on.</li>
                        <li><strong>Four swerve drives:</strong> Each wheel rotates independently 360°, enabling
                            omnidirectional movement and zero-turn-radius manoeuvres. It can go sideways. Most vehicles
                            cannot do this. We were pleased.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexible navigation:</strong> Adapts to changing factory layouts without requiring
                            infrastructure modifications (no magnetic strips, no rails, no excuses).</li>
                        <li><strong>Scalable design:</strong> The chassis architecture supports different payload
                            configurations for various industrial use cases, because one size fitting all is rarely true
                            in engineering.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                    <p>Material handling accounts for 40 to 50% of production activity in manufacturing environments,
                        and most existing AGV solutions depend on fixed physical guides like magnetic strips or colored
                        lines that are expensive and time-consuming to modify. As factories in Southeast Asia move
                        toward more flexible, reconfigurable production lines, the need for AGVs that can adapt in real
                        time is growing fast. This patent, developed through a collaboration between Politeknik Astra
                        and Asperio as the industry partner, represents a practical step toward more autonomous,
                        intelligent factory logistics.</p>

                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>Asperio, the company I founded, served as the industry partner on this project, which in
                        practice meant being the side responsible for turning academic research into something that
                        could actually survive contact with a factory floor. While the university team handled
                        prototyping and testing, Asperio contributed product design direction, manufacturing
                        supervision, and the kind of hard-won operational knowledge that only comes from having
                        previously built robots that did not behave as intended. The goal was not just a working
                        prototype but a commercially viable product with real deployment potential, and that lens shaped
                        every decision made along the way.</p>
