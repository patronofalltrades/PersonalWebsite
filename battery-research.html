                    <h3>The Research in Plain Language</h3>
                    <p>Lithium-ion batteries power almost everything — from phones to electric vehicles. But the
                        materials inside them have limits. Our research explored whether adding tiny tin particles to a
                        specific anode material could make it perform better. The short answer: it worked. We pushed the
                        material past its theoretical maximum capacity, which was a meaningful result for the field.</p>

                    <h3>My Role &amp; Experience</h3>
                    <ul class="detail-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Hands-on lab work:</strong> Spent months synthesizing materials, iterating on
                            compositions, and occasionally keeping a furnace company at 3AM while it took its time.
                            Research, I learned, is 90% waiting, 9% failed attempts, and 1% genuine surprise that
                            something worked.</li>
                        <li><strong>Operating heavy machinery with a great name:</strong> Ran a magnetic ball mill,
                            which sounds more exciting than it is, but is genuinely satisfying. Also operated electron
                            microscopes (SEM, TEM), X-ray diffraction equipment, and electrochemical testing setups,
                            developing deep fluency in materials analysis along the way.</li>
                        <li><strong>Academic writing:</strong> Co-authored the paper through multiple rounds of peer
                            review, learning how to communicate complex findings with precision and clarity. It takes
                            more drafts than you'd expect to say something simple and mean it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Collaborative research:</strong> Worked alongside professors and fellow researchers
                            at Universitas Indonesia, navigating the dynamics of academic teamwork, deadlines, debates,
                            and all.</li>
                        <li><strong>Presented in Bali (for science, officially):</strong> Traveled to present our
                            findings at the ICA-IUMRS 2018 International Conference. The research was rigorous. The
                            venue happened to be Bali. I have no complaints.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What Research Taught Me</h3>
                    <p>Lab research gave me a way of thinking I still carry into everything I build. It taught me to be
                        rigorous about evidence, comfortable with ambiguity, and honest about what the data actually
                        says versus what you wish it said. The patience required to run the same experiment dozens of
                        times, changing one variable at a time, is the same discipline that makes product iteration
                        work. Breakthroughs don't come from inspiration alone. They come from systematic persistence,
                        and sometimes from simply not going home when the furnace still has three hours to go.</p>
