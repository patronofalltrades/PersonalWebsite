          <h3>The Competition: INSEAD Product Games 9.0</h3>
          <p>The INSEAD Product Games is one of the world's most prestigious MBA product management competitions.
            Organized by INSEAD's TMT Club, it brings together top global business schools to compete on a single
            product brief — judged by real product leaders from Google, Stripe, and Grab.<sup><a href="#citation-1"
                class="citation-link" style="color:var(--accent); text-decoration:none;">[1]</a></sup></p>

          <div class="case-highlight">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 12px; font-weight: 500;">The Brief</p>
            <p><strong>"Reimagine Essential Access: Build the Next Vertical with Grab."</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 8px;">Teams had to design a sustainable, scalable, and user-centric new product
              vertical leveraging Grab's multi-sided ecosystem — covering drivers, merchants, logistics, and payments —
              to bridge a significant access gap for millions in Southeast Asia.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Submissions were judged on Product Concept & Design, Business Acumen, Product Display (Live Demo),
            Ecosystem Fit, and Frequency of Use. The prize: $10,000 USD cash and fast-tracked final interviews.</p>

          <h3>The Market: A $195 Billion Problem</h3>
          <p>Indonesia and the Philippines are home to nearly 5 million micro-retailers — <em>warungs</em> and
            <em>sari-sari</em> stores — that form the backbone of everyday commerce in Southeast Asia. Despite
            generating enormous economic value, they remain trapped in an inefficient, cash-heavy, and manually-operated
            supply chain.
          </p>
          <ul class="detail-bullets">
            <li><strong>3.5M</strong> Warungs operating in Indonesia ($155B total sales)</li>
            <li><strong>1.3M</strong> Sari-sari stores in the Philippines ($40B total sales)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The root cause isn't ambition — it's infrastructure. These store owners lack access to transparent pricing,
            reliable delivery, digital payments, and working capital. The supply chain is fragmented, causing stockouts,
            predatory credit (up to 240% APR), price opacity, and total digital exclusion.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="case-section">
          <h3>The Journey: From Barcelona to Singapore</h3>
          <p>We only found out about the competition two weeks before the deadline and didn't agree on our final concept
            until four days before submission. Here is how a team of three IESE MBA students — none of them developers —
            got it done.</p>
          <ul class="detail-bullets">
            <li><strong>Week 1 (Barcelona):</strong> Formed the team through a shared curiosity for tech. Felt imposter
              syndrome due to lack of engineering backgrounds, but pushed through.</li>
            <li><strong>Week 2 (Field Research):</strong> Conducted 11 in-depth interviews with warung/sari-sari owners
              and regional distributors. Realized the gap wasn't technology; it was last-mile distribution
              infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Week 3 (Refinement):</strong> Narrowed dozens of ideas to GrabTrade. Grab already had logistics,
              payments, and trust. They just needed the B2B marketplace layer connecting distributors directly to
              micro-retailers.</li>
            <li><strong>Finals Prep (20-Hour Flight):</strong> Selected as a top 4 global finalist. Flew from Barcelona
              to Singapore, turning an empty Qatar Airways cabin into a makeshift office to refine financials and
              stress-test assumptions with our Grab mentor.</li>
            <li><strong>The Finale (Singapore):</strong> "Vibe coded" a working prototype using AI (Claude and Loveable)
              to demo the full user flow live. The judges called our MVP "functionally complete." We won the Grand
              Prize.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="case-section">
          <h3>The Solution: GrabTrade</h3>
          <p>GrabTrade is a B2B marketplace and financing solution that digitizes the connection between regional
            distributors and micro-retailers, built on Grab's existing infrastructure.</p>
          <div class="solution-grid">
            <div class="solution-card">
              <h4>01. Live B2B Marketplace</h4>
              <p>Store owners browse and order from multiple distributors 24/7. A live price board shows real-time
                wholesale prices and promotions, giving warungs the transparency of a supermarket buyer.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="solution-card">
              <h4>02. Grab-Powered Delivery</h4>
              <p>Orders are pooled and auto-routed across Grab's existing fleet. Smart order pooling reduces delivery
                fees for store owners and increases earnings-per-km for Grab drivers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="solution-card">
              <h4>03. GrabTrade Financing</h4>
              <p>Digital transaction history enables responsible credit scoring. Store owners access formal working
                capital at 18% APR (vs. 240% informal lenders). Grab pays distributors upfront; store owners repay from
                daily sales.</p>

          <h3>Personal Learnings</h3>
          <p>Standing in front of product leaders from Grab, Google, Stripe, and INSEAD is an incredible pressure test.
            But more than the pitch itself, the true value came from the process of getting there—especially as three
            non-technical founders discovering what it means to build in the age of AI.</p>

          <ul class="detail-bullets">
            <li><strong>Managing Multiple POVs:</strong> Our team was composed of individuals from fundamentally
              different backgrounds: my manufacturing and industrial tech experience, Monica’s deep FMCG channel
              knowledge, and Uday’s cross-border finance expertise. Naturally, we all had strong—and often
              conflicting—ideas about what product to build. Merging those perspectives into a single cohesive narrative
              was the hardest part, but it forced us to find the most robust idea that survived the collective scrutiny
              of our three specialized lenses.</li>
            <li><strong>Grappling with "No-Code":</strong> I got introduced to Lovable by a second-year MBA student,
              Miguel, and dove headfirst into trying to "vibe-code" our MVP without an engineering background. The
              reality? I wasn't very efficient at first. I burned through more credits than I would like to admit trying
              to wrestle the AI into producing exactly what I wanted. But despite the friction, the experience shone a
              light on how these tools are fundamentally life-changing and are disrupting the world of product
              development. The barrier to entry has evaporated. I’ve continued to use these tools since, and there’s
              absolutely more to come.</li>
            <li><strong>Thinking as a True Product Manager:</strong> To build GrabTrade, we couldn't just design a
              pretty interface for the micro-retailer; we had to map out the entire ecosystem. This meant identifying
              multiple layers of stakeholders—how the product benefits the regional distributors, how it impacts Grab's
              internal divisions (Logistics vs. Fintech vs. Core Delivery), and how it aligns with Grab's long-term
              company trajectory in SEA. When you solve a problem at the community level, a powerful winning loop
              emerges that benefits the entire corporate apparatus.</li>
            <li><strong>Talk Less, Listen More:</strong> To truly understand customer problems, you must be hyper-local.
              Put yourself in the shoes of the people facing the problem every day. Our 11 in-person interviews were
              worth more than 100 hours of desk research.</li>
            <li><strong>Taste, Judgment, and Speed of Learning:</strong> We were an MBA team with no developers. Two
              years ago, that would have been a death sentence in a product building competition. Today, by leveraging
              AI tools like Claude and Lovable to "vibe-code" our MVP, we realized that technical execution is becoming
              a commodity. What matters now is your taste in design, your judgment on what features actually solve the
              problem, and your sheer speed of iteration.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't Reinvent the Wheel:</strong> Innovation isn't always about creating a net-new paradigm.
              Often, it's about tailoring existing rails and resources (like Grab's delivery and fintech ecosystem) to
              the very real, unsexy needs of users.</li>
            <li><strong>Solve for the Community:</strong> Always look after those behind the users—the families, the
              community, the local economy. When they thrive, a powerful winning loop emerges. This was Grab's long-term
              vision in action.</li>
