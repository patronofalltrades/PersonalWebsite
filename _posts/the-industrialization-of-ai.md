description: "How emerging economies will leapfrog legacy systems using generative AI and automation."

The most important thing I've learned is conviction: the ability to see an idea clearly and refuse to let it die until it becomes real. That's what separates operators from observers.

I believe Southeast Asia is on the verge of something significant. In the next decade, as AI supercharges productivity across industries, the region won't just be a participant in the global economy. It will be a proving ground for how emerging economies leapfrog into the future. I want to help initiate that.

### 1. The Physical World Needs Software

When we began building our VR edtech platform, Asperio, the thesis was simple: the physical world needs software to scale training. What we found was that the barrier wasn't technology; it was the lack of localized, practical implementations that factories could actually use without massive overhead.

AI changes this equation entirely.

### 2. General-Purpose Robotics

General-purpose robotics and vision models are no longer constrained to highly controlled environments. We are moving from hard-coded automation (where a robotic arm does one precise thing 10,000 times) to adaptive automation (where the system observes, learns, and reacts to anomalies).

In markets with legacy manufacturing infrastructure, this isn't just an upgrade—it's a complete paradigm shift.
